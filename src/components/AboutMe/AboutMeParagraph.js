            Hi, my name is Regis!
            
            I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science - just another university student trying to figure out life.<br></br><br></br>
            
            When I’m not doing homework or studying, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, swimming (go YM Rubber Duckies!), playing piano, and taking photos. I’m always interested in learning new things such as how to code websites - like this one!<br></br><br></br>
            
            You can check out some of my projects or photography below. I’m always open to discussing new ideas, opportunities, or simply chatting, so feel free to contact me as well!
