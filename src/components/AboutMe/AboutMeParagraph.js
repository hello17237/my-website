            Hi, my name is Regis!
            
            I'm an undergraduate student at the <a href='https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/' target="_blank">University of Toronto</a> studying <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3s8hWgOeAs' target="_blank">Engineering Science</a> - just another university student trying to figure out life.<br></br><br></br>
            
            When I'm not doing homework or studying, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, swimming (go <a href='https://www.instagram.com/ymcirubberduckies/' target="_blank">YM Rubber Duckies</a>!), playing piano, and <a href='#photography'>taking photos</a>. I'm always interested in learning new things such as how to code websites - like this one!<br></br><br></br>
            
            You can check out some of my <a href='#projects'>projects</a> or <a href='#photography'>photography</a> below. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, opportunities, or simply chatting, so feel free to <a href='mailto:zhaoregis@gmail.com'>contact me</a> as well!
